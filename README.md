## Problem Domain

With all the TV shows currently available, it's increasingly difficult to choose your next show. What if there was a site where you could go to see personal recommendations from other users who have watched and reviewed TV shows? This avoids relying on recommendations from streaming services (who are only pushing their own shows) or critical review sites (Iike Rotten Tomatoes), and helps you to find shows that you will actually enjoy watching.

## Project Overview

**Introducing "The Binge", a more personal TV review app**

The Binge allows a user to:

- Create an account, and login
- View shows and recommendations for shows other users have watched and reviewed
- Add a new show to the database (by searching a 3rd party API)
- Select a title to view additional info and all reviews
- Visit their personal library page to see shows they have reviewed

*Technologies used:*

- Frontend: React, Redux, Material UI
- Backend: Postgres, SQL/Sequelize, Axios, Express
- Project Management: Invision, GitHub
